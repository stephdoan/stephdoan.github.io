          Nintendo started their venture into the home console gaming scene with the NES.
          The GameBoy was their first venture into portable gaming and was met with great success.

          Looking at Nintendo's console history, one may notice the fairly even 
          amount of handheld and home console. Even the Nintendo Switch, which was marketed
          as a "portable home console" was given an exclusively portable counterpart, the Switch Lite.
          In many instances, the handheld outsold its home console counterpart!

          Sony has a strong lead in home consoles with its multiple Playstation iterations.
          Nintendo has decent showing in the home console market, with the Wii rivaling its Playstation
          competition. The handheld market is almost exclusively Nintendo. The Switch is included in both graphs due to its
          unique switching feature. <strong>Bold</strong> indicates the console is still in production.
